### Enhanced Cloud-Based Airline Booking Service Project Outline

#### 1. **Project Overview**
   - **Objective:** Build an enhanced cloud-based airline booking service that integrates multiple microservices using modern technologies, including AWS services, for scalability and robustness.
   - **Technologies:** FastAPI, Spring Boot, SQLAlchemy, Docker, AWS (EC2, ECS, Lambda, S3, RDS, DynamoDB, SQS, CloudWatch), PostgreSQL.

#### 2. **Project Architecture**
   - **Microservices:** Booking Service, Payment Service, Notification Service, Flight Management Service.
   - **AWS Integration:** Each service will be deployed using AWS services for improved scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

#### 3. **Microservices Overview**
   - **Booking Service:**
     - **Endpoints:** Create booking, Get booking details.
     - **Database:** PostgreSQL on AWS RDS.
   - **Payment Service:**
     - **Endpoints:** Process payment, Get payment status.
     - **Database:** DynamoDB.
   - **Notification Service:**
     - **Endpoints:** Send notification.
     - **Database:** None, uses AWS SQS and Lambda.
   - **Flight Management Service:**
     - **Endpoints:** Create flight, Get flight details, Update flight status.
     - **Database:** PostgreSQL on AWS RDS.

#### 4. **AWS Services Integration**
   - **EC2:**
     - Deploy backend services on EC2 instances.
   - **ECS:**
     - Containerize and deploy microservices using ECS.
   - **S3:**
     - Store static assets and media files.
   - **RDS:**
     - Use PostgreSQL for Booking and Flight Management services.
   - **DynamoDB:**
     - Use for Payment Service to store transaction details.
   - **Lambda:**
     - Implement serverless functions for the Notification Service.
   - **SQS:**
     - Use for message queuing between services.
   - **CloudWatch:**
     - Monitor application logs and metrics.

#### 5. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - **CodePipeline:**
     - Set up CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline for automated testing and deployment.
   - **Stages:**
     - Source: Connect to GitHub repository.
     - Build: Use CodeBuild to build Docker images.
     - Test: Automated testing using pytest for FastAPI and JUnit for Spring Boot.
     - Deploy: Deploy to AWS services.

#### 6. **Development Process**
   - **Set Up AWS Environment:**
     - Create an AWS account and configure IAM roles and permissions.
   - **Deploy Backend Services on EC2:**
     - Launch EC2 instances, install dependencies, and deploy FastAPI and Spring Boot applications.
   - **Containerize and Deploy Using ECS:**
     - Write Dockerfiles, build images, and deploy using ECS.
   - **Use S3 for Static Assets:**
     - Create S3 buckets and upload static assets.
   - **Use RDS for PostgreSQL:**
     - Create RDS instances and connect applications.
   - **Integrate DynamoDB:**
     - Create DynamoDB tables and integrate with Payment Service.
   - **Implement Serverless Functions with Lambda:**
     - Create Lambda functions for Notification Service.
   - **Set Up SQS for Messaging:**
     - Create SQS queues and integrate with microservices.
   - **Monitor with CloudWatch:**
     - Set up CloudWatch for logs and metrics.
   - **CI/CD with AWS CodePipeline:**
     - Create and configure CI/CD pipeline.

#### 7. **Testing and Validation**
   - **Unit Testing:**
     - Write unit tests for each service.
   - **Integration Testing:**
     - Test the integration between services and AWS components.
   - **Load Testing:**
     - Perform load testing to ensure scalability and performance.
